- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lingzhi Luo@FLYR01
- ğŸ‘€ I have a broad spectrum of interests in integrated photonics, semiconductor physics and devices, electromagnetics and wireless technology, and multiphysics simulation.  I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of these areas  and the application of artificial intelligence on these fields.
